Scripts to create docker containers backups 
# Docker Script Backup Repository

This repository contains a collection of Docker scripts along with a backup mechanism to ensure the safety and availability of your Docker configurations. The backup process allows you to easily restore your Docker environment in case of data loss or system failures.

## Features

- Backup and restore Docker scripts and configurations.
- Automatic scheduling of backups for regular intervals.
- Support for incremental backups to minimize storage requirements.
- Version control for Docker scripts using Git.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface for backup operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Docker Script Backup repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diaz-alx/somes_docker_scripts.git
```


2. **Configure backup settings:** Customize the backup settings according to your needs. Update the configuration file located at `docker-compose.yml` to specify backup intervals, storage locations, and any other relevant parameters.

3. **Perform initial backup:** Run the backup script to perform the initial backup of your Docker scripts.

```bash
./backup_container_id.sh
```

4. **Schedule regular backups:** Set up a cron job or any other scheduling mechanism to run the backup script at the specified intervals. This ensures that your Docker scripts are regularly backed up without manual intervention.

## Usage

### Backup

To manually trigger a backup, run the following command:

```bash
./backup_container_id.sh
```

This command will create a backup of your Docker scripts and configurations based on the settings specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Restore

In case you need to restore a previously backed up Docker environment, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the backup to restore:** Browse the backup directory and locate the desired backup based on the timestamp or any other identifying information.

2. **Restore the backup:** Run the restore script, specifying the path to the backup directory:

```bash
python restore.py /path/to/backup
```

This command will restore the Docker scripts and configurations from the specified backup directory.
